VIM

first and foremost is to EXIST VIM use 
:q!

vim works in modes
so, use ESC to exist mode

Now,once you exist your file all the settings disappear and you don't want that so we configure the settings file
How?
->vi ~/.vimrc
->set the settings 
->:w or :wq	write the changes

INSERT
i for before the cursor =4
a for after the cursor 
o for next line below
now these with SHIFT
i jumps in the beginning of the line
a jumps in the end of the line
o opens a line above 


:set number  //puts line numbers
:set relativenumber    //to set relative lines 
:set mouse=a  //to activate the mouse function
:set tabstop=4
:set shiftwidth=4
:set autoindent
colourscheme //then select your preferred one
colourscheme slate


u in normalMode will do the UNDO function and
CTRL+R is for the REDO

VISUAL MODE  //to select and then perform certain functions
v and arrow key to select the text
d to delete
u to undo the delete
y for yanking i.e copying
p to paste
10p to paste 10 times
dd to delete the whole line
5dd to delete 5 lines
yy to copy the entire line
P pastes above the line 
p pastes below the line


INSERT MODE
dd line gone
so, if you want to delete and change the line 
cc
D deletes the full line after the cursor
C changes the rest of the line
Y is the same as yy
r to replace
w to jump to next word
now W considers only space separation to be one word but w considers - as well to be separation between words
similarly b for backward
dw deletes word but if in words the deletes latter part only so use diw to delete full word
d2w deletes two words
d2b deletes two words backwards
similarly,
ciw to change in a word
e jumps to end of the word
I jumps beginning of the line
0 jumps begin of the line
$ jumps end of the line
d0 deletes till the beginning
d$ deletes till the end

ci" change in quotation marks (used inside brackets) and similarly
di"
yi"

d5w delete 5 words
5d5w 5 times delete 5 words
5yy copy 5 lines

% if you use % on a bracket you can go to the end of that bracket

t* to jump before the special character *
f* to jump on the special character *
T* and F* does the same thing backwards

gg to go to the end of the page
G to go to the end of the page
xG to jump to that x line
:x to jump to that x line





so, there are many types of VISUAL modes like visual line, visual block mode
in visual mode to select multiple lines
SHIFT + V + arrow UP/DOWN

Ctrl + V to enter VISUAL block mode, then
SHIFT + V + arrow UP/DOWN


== to correct the line indentation


/word to jump to that word then,
n to jump to the next similar word
now to reset
/sdinf    any nonsence
now go to any word
* will take you to the next occurence of the word(downwards)
# will also do the same backwards



mark warpoints

ma as in mark that point as a
then 'a to jump to that waypoint



zz to center that line to the centre of the page
